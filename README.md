OpenIGTLink Demo: Bi-directional Communication
==============================================

Overview
--------
This is an example program demonstrating how to write a "real-world" application
using the OpenIGTLink library. In particular, the example demonstrates how
to handle bi-directional OpenIGTLink communication, where OpenIGTLink messages
are transfered in both ways between server and client.

The example program consists of following two programs:
- *Server* is the main demo program that receives requests from a client program
  and send dummy tracking data to the client.
- *Client* is a program to test the Server. It connects to the server program,
  request for dummy tracking data, and recieve them.
